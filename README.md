# Ruby Substrings
My second Ruby project made for the Odin Project (TOP). It is a simple string analyzer program that uses a pre-defined dictionary in order to check whenever or not a given string has an element (a string within the dictionary array) within the entered string itself (for example "howdy" should return a hash with "how" and "howdy" strings within if they are defined within the dictionary). It works for capitalized letters within the string as well (the program downcases the given string before analyzing it).

## How to Run It?
To run the downloaded program, open your terminal console in Linux/Git and navigate to ../ruby-sub-strings, then enter ruby sub-strings.rb in the console (make sure Ruby is installed for your console!).

## Editing The Dictionary
The dictionary and the given string is hardcoded by my keyboard, but if you wish to, you can edit the dictionary variable or the given string within sub-strings.rb, where you can add or remove certain strings within the dictionary array.
